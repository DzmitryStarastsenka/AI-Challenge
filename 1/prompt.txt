You are an expert database consultant. I need your help to select the most suitable database for a social platform project based on the following requirements:

1. The platform will have millions of users.
2. It needs to store user profiles, posts, and connections between users.
3. High data read speed is required, with the operations expected to be 80% reads and 20% writes.
4. Scalability is essential as the user base is expected to grow rapidly.

To ensure we make the best choice, please analyze these requirements step by step, using a Chain-of-Thought reasoning approach. Break down each requirement, explain its implications for the database, and justify your final recommendation clearly.
