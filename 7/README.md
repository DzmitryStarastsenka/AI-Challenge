# Sea Battle CLI Game (Modernized)

This is a modernized, well-structured command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Sea Battle (Battleship) game, completely refactored using modern JavaScript (ES6+) with comprehensive testing.

## Features

- **Modern JavaScript**: Built with ES6+ features including classes, modules, async/await, and arrow functions
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for game logic, players, board management, and I/O
- **Intelligent CPU Opponent**: Advanced AI with hunt and target modes for challenging gameplay
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100+ unit tests covering all core functionality with 93%+ code coverage
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved input validation, error handling, and game flow
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Proper encapsulation and inheritance for maintainable code

## Gameplay

You play against an intelligent CPU opponent. Both players place their ships randomly on a 10x10 grid. Players take turns guessing coordinates to hit the opponent's ships. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.

### Game Symbols
- `~` represents water (unknown)
- `S` represents your ships on your board
- `X` represents a hit (on either board)
- `O` represents a miss (on either board)

### Game Rules
- 10x10 game board
- 3 ships per player, each 3 squares long
- Ships are placed randomly at game start
- Enter coordinates as two digits (e.g., `00`, `34`, `99`)
- First to sink all enemy ships wins!

## Installation & Setup

1. **Ensure you have Node.js installed** (version 14 or higher recommended)
   - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal

3. **Install dependencies** (for testing):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Run

### Start the Game
```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
node seabattle.js
```

## Architecture Overview

The game follows modern software engineering principles:

- **Ship Class**: Manages individual ship state, hits, and sunk detection
- **Board Class**: Handles grid operations, ship placement, and guess processing
- **Player Classes**: Base class with HumanPlayer and CPUPlayer extensions
- **Game Class**: Orchestrates game flow and manages player interactions
- **GameInput Class**: Handles all user input/output with async/await patterns

## Key Improvements from Original

### Modernization
- âœ… ES6+ syntax (classes, modules, const/let, arrow functions)
- âœ… Async/await pattern for input handling
- âœ… Modern array methods and destructuring
- âœ… Template literals and default parameters

### Code Quality
- âœ… Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Eliminated all global variables
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling
- âœ… Extensive JSDoc documentation
- âœ… Consistent naming conventions

### Testing
- âœ… 100+ unit tests with Jest framework
- âœ… 93%+ code coverage
- âœ… Integration tests for complete game flows
- âœ… Mock objects for isolated testing
- âœ… Edge case coverage

### Functionality
- âœ… All original game mechanics preserved
- âœ… Enhanced input validation
- âœ… Improved AI with strategic targeting
- âœ… Better user interface and messaging
- âœ… Game statistics and state management

## CPU AI Strategy

The CPU opponent uses an intelligent strategy:

1. **Hunt Mode**: Random targeting to find ships
2. **Target Mode**: When a hit is scored, systematically target adjacent squares
3. **Smart Targeting**: Prioritizes likely ship locations based on previous hits
4. **Collision Avoidance**: Avoids impossible placements and duplicate guesses

## Development

This project demonstrates modern JavaScript development practices:

- Object-oriented programming with ES6 classes
- Module system with import/export
- Comprehensive testing with Jest
- Error handling and input validation
- Async programming patterns
- Clean code principles

## Testing

The project includes extensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

Test coverage exceeds 93% with comprehensive coverage of:
- All class methods and properties
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Game flow and state transitions
- Input validation scenarios
- AI behavior patterns

## Contributing
