## Summary

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student who works part-time as a postman, presents with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area, lasting a few seconds at a time, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. The pain sometimes radiates to the neck and rates a 6/10 in intensity. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, or viral symptoms currently, though the patient recently recovered from the flu. The patient has no significant past medical history, takes occasional Tylenol, and has no allergies or surgeries.

A significant concern is the recent death of the patient’s father from a heart attack two weeks ago, which heightens the patient's anxiety about having a similar event. The patient denies smoking, recreational drug use, and drinks alcohol only occasionally.

The clinician empathizes with the patient’s fears, plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate heart function, and advises the patient not to worry excessively until results are available. The overall approach is cautious, aiming to rule out cardiac issues while providing reassurance.
